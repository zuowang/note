Setting up SSH for Remote Collection

Configure SSH to work in password-less mode so it does not prompt for the password on each invocation.

For remote collection on the Linux host system, set up the password-less mode as follows:

    Generate the key with an empty passphrase:

    host> ssh-keygen

    Copy the key to target system:

    host> ssh-copy-id user@target

    Alternatively, if you do not have ssh-copy-id on your host system, do the following:

    host> cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@target 'cat >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'

    host> ssh user@target 'chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys'


Vtune:
Remote Linux SSH
Attach to process

cd /opt/intel/vtune_amplifier_xe/sepdk/src
./insmod-sep3 -q

amplxe-gui&

su to root
amplxe-gui&
local
attach to process

You can temporarily disable this restriction (and revert to the old behaviour allowing your user to ptrace (gdb) any of their other processes) by doing:

echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/kernel/yama/ptrace_scope

To permanently allow it edit /etc/sysctl.d/10-ptrace.conf and change the line:

kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 1

To read

kernel.yama.ptrace_scope = 0
