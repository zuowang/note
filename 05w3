yum info device-mapper-libs
yum install device-mapper-libs
the following possible configs are located in /etc/wgetrc just uncomment and use...
# You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http, https, and ftp.
# They will override the value in the environment.
#https_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
#http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
#ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

# If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.

To extend Arun's answer above, for this to work in Centos 7 I had to remove the "export" commands. So edit
/etc/sysconfig/docker
And add:
HTTP_PROXY="http://<proxy_host>:<proxy_port>"
HTTPS_PROXY="https://<proxy_host>:<proxy_port>"
http_proxy="${HTTP_PROXY}"
https_proxy="${HTTPS_PROXY}"
Then restart docker:
sudo service docker restart

docker save and docker load will preserve image metadata (CMD, ENTRYPOINT, etc) and all layers.

docker export and docker import don't preserve metadata. This is by design and it's not being changed.

docker import will be extended with a --change option to allow CMD, ENTRYPOINT, ENV and many other options to be set. Please take a look at #7239 for the plan concerning this, especially #7239 (comment)

Squashing layers will also be implemented, so that will be another way to address the problem of flattening images while keeping metadata.
